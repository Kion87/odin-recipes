    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Arrosto, or Italian roast, is a comforting and flavorful dish where a
        cut of meat (typically beef, pork, or veal) is slow-roasted with
        aromatic herbs, vegetables, and wine. It's a classic Sunday meal in
        Italy, known for its tender texture and rich, herb-infused gravy. Served
        with roasted vegetables or polenta, it’s a centerpiece of Italian family
        gatherings.

        <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of rosemary</li>
        <li>2-3 sage leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <h3>For the sauce and vegetables</h3>
        <li>2 large carrots (peeled and chopped)</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks (chopped)</li>
        <li>1 large onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>3-4 medium potatoes (optional, quartered)</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups beef or chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter (optional, for a richer gravy)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
        <li>Season the beef chuck roast with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>
          In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
          garlic, rosemary, and sage. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the beef to the skillet and sear on all sides until browned, about
          2-3 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the beef to a roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Add the carrots, celery, onion, and potatoes to the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the wine and stock over the meat and vegetables.</li>
        <li>
          Cover the pan with foil and roast in the oven for 2-2.5 hours, or
          until the meat is tender and the vegetables are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the foil and roast for another 30-45 minutes, or until the meat
          is browned and the vegetables are tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the meat from the oven and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the meat is resting, make the gravy. In a small saucepan, melt
          the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and whisk until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add the wine and stock to the saucepan and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>
          Cook the sauce over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until it
          thickens, about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Slice the meat and serve with the gravy and vegetables.</li>
      </ol>
