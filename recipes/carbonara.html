    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti or rigatoni (or pasta of your choice)</li>
      <li>150g (5 oz) guanciale or pancetta (cut into small cubes)</li>
      <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>1 whole egg</li>
      <li>60g (2 oz) Pecorino Romano cheese (grated)
    </li>
      <li>60g (2 oz) Parmesan cheese (grated)
    </li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol></ol>
      <li>Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the guanciale or pancetta and cook until it's crispy.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the guanciale or pancetta. Remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta, stirring quickly to combine. The residual heat will cook the eggs, creating a creamy sauce.</li>
      <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and a generous pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese and black pepper.</li>
